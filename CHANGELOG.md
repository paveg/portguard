## [0.2.1] - 2025-08-11

### Fixed

- **CLI Commands Implementation**: All major CLI commands now fully functional
  - `portguard list` - List managed processes with table and JSON output
  - `portguard stop <id|port>` - Stop processes by ID or port number with force option
  - `portguard clean` - Clean up stopped processes with dry-run support
- **Hook Compatibility**: Fixed `portguard intercept` to support both "tool" and "tool_name" fields
- **Performance**: Use `strconv.Itoa` instead of `fmt.Sprintf` for better performance
- **Documentation Accuracy**: README.md now accurately reflects actual functionality

### Added

- **JSON Output Support**: All commands support `--json` flag for AI tool integration
- **Dry-run Mode**: `portguard clean --dry-run` shows what would be cleaned
- **Force Options**: Force stop and cleanup options for better control
- **Better Error Handling**: Improved error messages and user feedback

### Technical Details

```bash
# New fully functional commands
portguard list --json --all      # List all processes including stopped
portguard stop abc123 --force    # Force stop process by ID  
portguard stop 3000              # Stop process by port
portguard clean --dry-run        # Preview cleanup actions

{
  "hooks": {
    "preToolUse": {

      "command": "portguard intercept"
    },
    "postToolUse": {
      "enabled": true,
      "command": "portguard intercept"

### Server Detection Patterns

Automatically detects and manages:

- `npm run dev`, `npm start`, `yarn dev`
